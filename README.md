## NEVER AFK
#
I wrote this simple program to prevent AFK timers in games with long queues. 
Tested and works in Archeage and Wildstar, probably most games.
I take no responsibility if you get banned using this program.

#### Quick setup
If you don't want to enter all the settings every time, you can follow the example
in the bat folder and create a bat for your game with your settings.

#### Why does the program not find my game?
You need to search for (parts of) the name of the window-frame not 
the name of the game. Look at the border at the  top of the
game (when using window mode) and you should see the window name.  


#### Can I get banned for using this application?
It's a low risk but entirely possible. You are most likely to get banned
from in game reports not from anti-cheat software. Some mice and keyboards 
use similar inputs for their macro functions.


#### Why does it not work on X game?
To get the program running on some applications you might have to 
do the following:

- Make sure this program (the bot) is running with admin 
privilege (right-click, run as administrator)

- If you are using a fullscreen application try changing it to 
windowed mode or borderless windowed mode.

- A few games use driver level input there is not much we can do.

#### Cross-platform?
Windows only
