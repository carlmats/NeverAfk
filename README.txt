NEVER AFK
I wrote this simple program to prevent AFK timers in games with long queues. 
Tested and works in Archeage and Wildstar, probably most games.
I take no responsibility if you get banned using this program.

[Q/A]

Q - Why does the program not find my game?
******************************************************************************

You need to type (parts of) the name of the window frame not 
the name of the game. Look at the border at the  top of the
game (when using window mode) and you should see the window name.  
******************************************************************************

Q - Can I get banned for using this application?
******************************************************************************
It's a low risk but it's entirely possible. You are most likely to get banned
from in game reports not from anti-cheat software. Some mice and keyboards 
use similar inputs for their macro functions.
******************************************************************************

Q - Why does it not work on X game?
******************************************************************************
To get the program running on some applications you might have to 
do the following:

1) Make sure this program (the bot) is running with admin 
privilege (right-click, run as administrator)

2) If you are using a full screen application try changing it to 
windowed mode or borderless windowed mode.

3) A few games use driver level input there is not much we can do.
