NEVER AFK

I wrote this simple program to prevent afk timers in games with long queues. 
Tested and works in Archeage and Wildstar, probably most games.
I take no responsibility if you get banned using this program.

[Q/A]

Q - Why does the program not find my game?
************************************************************************************************************
You need to type (parts of) the name of the window frane not the name of the game. Look at the border at the 
top of the game (when using window mode) and you should see the windows name.

Q - Can I get banned for using this application?
************************************************************************************************************
I'ts a low risk but it's entierly possible. You are most likley to get banned from ingame reports not
from anti-cheat software. Some mice and keyboards use similar inputs for their macro functions.

Q - Why does it not work on X game?
************************************************************************************************************
To get the program running on some applications you might have to do the following:

1) Make sure the program is running with admin privilege (Right-Click, Run As Administrator)

2) If you are using a fullscreen application try changing it to windowed mode or borderless windowed mode.

3) (last resort) If the application still does not work you are likely dealing with some countermeassures 
from the application. The application does not have access to processes run on another user so 
set up a new user and run this program on that user. Create a new user with admin rights. Rightclick on
this application and use "run as > the new user". 

4) A few games use driver level input there is not much we can do.
