[Q/A]
Q - Why does it not work on [this] application?
A - To get the program running on some applications you might have to do the following:

1) Make sure the program is running with Admin privilege(Right-Click on script, Run As Administrator)

2) If you are using a fullscreen application try changing it to windowed mode or borderless windowed mode.

3) A few games use driver level input and will not allow us to use the keys that are bound within the game 
try unbinding the key from the game.

4) (last resort) If the application still does not work you are likely dealing with some countermeassures 
from the application. The application probably does not have access to processes run on another user so 
set up a new user and run this program on that user. Create a new user with admin rights. Rightclick on
this application and use "run as > the new user".
